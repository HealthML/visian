A larger threshold results in larger grown regions.",

The grown region is then displayed as a preview and can be tuned using the slider in the window, which opens up in the bottom left of your screen. Once you are happy with the tuned review segmentation, you can apply it to the currently active segmentation layer. The threshold controls how large the difference between neighboring pixels/voxels intensities or color values may be while still allowing the region to grow further. A larger threshold results in larger grown regions.",

  "info-voxel-data": "The voxel data of the loaded image is displayed in the bottom left corner of the editor. On slower hardware, this can lead to reduced performance.
